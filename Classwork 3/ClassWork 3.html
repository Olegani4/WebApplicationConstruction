<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
  He passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward following close behind. They walked softly, 
  as men do instinctively at night. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A rising wind 
  made some of the windows rattle. 
  </p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the floor, and taking out the key, turned it
in the lock. “You insist on knowing, Basil?” he asked in a low voice. 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“Yes.” 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“I am delighted,” he answered, smiling. Then he added, somewhat harshly, “You are the one man in the world 
who is entitled to know everything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you think”; and, 
taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in. A cold current of air passed them, and the light shot up 
for a moment in a flame of murky orange. He shuddered. “Shut the door behind you,” he whispered, as he placed 
the lamp on the table. 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
Hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression. The room looked as if it had not been lived in for years. 
A faded Flemish tapestry, a curtained picture, an old Italian cassone, and an almost empty book-case—that was 
all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a table. As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle 
that was standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was 
in holes. A mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting. There was a damp odour of mildew. 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw that curtain back, and you will see mine.” 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
The voice that spoke was cold and cruel. “You are mad, Dorian, or playing a part,” muttered Hallward, frowning. 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“You won’t? Then I must do it myself,” said the young man, and he tore the curtain from its rod and flung it on 
the ground. 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
An exclamation of horror broke from the painter’s lips as he saw in the dim light the hideous face on the canvas 
grinning at him. There was something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing. Good heavens! 
it was Dorian Gray’s own face that he was looking at! The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled 
that marvellous beauty. There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet on the sensual mouth. 
The sodden eyes had kept something of the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet completely
passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat. Yes, it was Dorian himself. But who had done it? He 
seemed to recognize his own brushwork, and the frame was his own design. The idea was monstrous, yet he felt 
afraid. He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the picture. In the left-hand corner was his own name, 
traced in long letters of bright vermilion. 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire. He had never done that. Still, it was his own picture. 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with that strange expression that one sees on 
the faces of those who are absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting. There was neither real sorrow 
in it nor real joy. There was simply the passion of the spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his 
eyes. He had taken the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so. 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“What does this mean?” cried Hallward, at last. His own voice sounded shrill and curious in his ears. 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“Years ago, when I was a boy,” said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in his hand, “you met me, flattered me, and 
taught me to be vain of my good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who explained to me the 
wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment that, 
even now, I don’t know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you would call it a prayer....” 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is impossible. The room is damp. Mildew has got into the 
canvas. The paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them. I tell you the thing is impossible.” 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“Ah, what is impossible?” murmured the young man, going over to the window and leaning his forehead against the 
cold, mist-stained glass. 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“You told me you had destroyed it.” 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“I was wrong. It has destroyed me.” 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“I don’t believe it is my picture.” 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“Can’t you see your ideal in it?” said Dorian bitterly. 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“My ideal, as you call it...” 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“As you called it.” 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such an ideal as I shall never meet again. This 
is the face of a satyr.” 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“It is the face of my soul.” 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a devil.” 
</p>

<p style="font-weight:600;">
“Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil,” cried Dorian with a wild gesture of despair.
